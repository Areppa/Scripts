# Small scripts & script templates

This repository contains a collection of scripts that can be used directly, as well as scripts that serve as templates or components that can be incorporated into new scripts.

### **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
Some of these scripts might destroy your files if used incorrectly! I take no responsibility if you happen to remove all of your files. To prevent that I recommend you check how these scripts work and figure out how commands work inside these scripts.

### Code source & credits
Most of these scripts are written by me. Some of these scripts are partially copied from the wonderful internet. Unfortunately, I don't have links for those sources, because many of these scripts have been copied a long time ago and those sources might not even exist anymore.
