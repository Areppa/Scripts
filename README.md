# Small scripts & script templates

This repository contains small scripts and script templates that can be used to create new (and better) scripts.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** Some of these scripts might destroy your files if used incorretly!

Some of these scripts are partially copied from the wonderfull internet. Unfortunately I don't have links for those sources, because many of these scripts have been copied a long time ago and those sources might not even exists anymore.
